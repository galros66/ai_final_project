## Final Project - Basketball Bot

As part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, I programmed a final project of a robot learning to pick up and throw a ball into a basket. In order to solve these problems I used Q-Learning and a Genetic Algorithm.
There is a more detailed explanation in the [report.pdf](https://github.com/galros66/ai_final_project/blob/main/ai_final_project/report.pdf) file

### Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all packages that imported to the project.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

### How To Run
Type the following:
```python
python3 basketball.py
```
